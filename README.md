<h1>Course Project: Ticket Rush</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project developed a queue-based ticket-selling system to manage crowds for popular events when ticket sales open to the public. The objective was to prevent server overload during high-demand events like concerts or shows. By implementing a queue system, users were placed in a sequential order, allowing only one entry per user to deter scalpers. The program aimed for simplicity, considering the approaching Thanksgiving period and avoiding complexities.

--- Ticket.java, TicketSiteUser.java, QueueADT.java, and LinkedNode.java are provided by professor/TA.
